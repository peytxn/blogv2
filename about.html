            Hello! My name is Peyton Blanchard, and I am a senior at the University of Michigan studying both Games & Interactive Media and Information Science. I am also minoring in Computer Science. I was born and raised in Brighton, Michigan, where I atteneded Brighton High School.

            Here are a few of my interests:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Video games</li>
            <li>Graphic design</li>
            <li>Reading</li>
            <li>Concerts</li>
            <li>Fashion</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I also love to spend time with my friends and family, and frequently visit home. I also adore cats, and my family has eight of them! My favorite is my cat Arya, who is nicknamed "Princess" because of her diva-like attitude. I'm currently job searching, as my previous employment did not fit my schedule this semester. I'm hoping to find a position, whether a job or internship, in the industry. Feel free to reach out to me through the contact page if you have any questions or opportunities!
